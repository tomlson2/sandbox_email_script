This only works for gmail and will require some setting up on your google account (2FA *required*)
Follow [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73214197) SO answer to set up your account.
Fill in your credentials (email (SENDER) and newly generated password in the script)

Add the body content of your email to email_content.txt
Make sure that you do not add your greeting to email_content.txt as it needs to dynamically update in the script.

The only requirement is the Python Pandas library.
