I am a Software Engineer in SB03 and am hoping to meet as many peers as possible in our cohort. I was wondering if you would be willing to set up a quick chat for next week?

I would be hoping to share ideas and learn more about you. To me this is less about finding specific cofounders and more about meeting and learning about your approach as an entrepreneur.

I'll be completely honest, I wrote a python script to send this to the whole cohort, but I am serious about meeting you 1 on 1.
